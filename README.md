# circuitpython-thermal-printer-on-button-press
For use with Adafruit microcontroller running CircuitPython (in my case an RP2040), and a thermal printer with cpython lib. This was implemented as part of an artwork/joke, where on a button press, an incredibly long greeting would print on a slow-moving receipt printer. The total time for the greeting to finish was around 60 seconds. 

Current firmware and corresponding libraries for circuit python can be found at Adafruit.org
